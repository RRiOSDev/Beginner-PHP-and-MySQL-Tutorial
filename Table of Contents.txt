=== About the Working Files===
This PHP course is project based and users are encouraged to follow along and replicate the examples. To assist we have provided working files which can be found on the DVD in the folder called "Working Files", users who have purchased this product on digital download will find the files within the main folder. These working files have been created to work within the Sublime text editor which the author uses in this course.
==============================

=== Users who don't wish to use the recommended Sublime text editor ===
While we strongly recommend that users take advantage of pre-prepared code snippets and the many features offered by the Sublime text code editor, some users may wish to use another editor to follow this course. While we do not recommend using a different editor, to assist these customers we've also included the snippets / working files ( where possible ) in plain text format. These can be found in the "Working Files-None-Sublime text Users" folder and for customers who don't wish to use the Sublime text editor these text based working files should be used. Certain lessons may require none Sublime text users to manually input code based on the authors screen.
==============================

To help you stay on track we have laid out a schedule of the order in which the working files should be used.
